BINARY SEARCH TREE


Introduction to Binary Search Trees (BST)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, addition, and deletion operations. The key properties of a BST are:

Node Structure: Each node in a BST contains a key and pointers to its left and right children.
Ordering Property: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are smaller, and all keys in its right subtree are larger.
Inorder Traversal: Traversing the tree in inorder (left-root-right) results in sorted order of keys.



Summary of the Code
The provided code is a Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the tree in an inorder manner. Additionally, a simple console-based user interface allows users to interact with the BST.


Node Class:
Represents a node in the BST with a key and pointers to left and right children.


BinarySearchTree Class:

Contains the root node and methods to manipulate the BST.
insert(int key): Inserts a new key into the BST.
delete(int key): Deletes a key from the BST.
search(int key): Searches for a key in the BST.
inorder(): Displays the BST elements in inorder traversal.


Main Class:

Provides a simple user interface to interact with the BST.
Options include inserting, deleting, searching, displaying the tree, and exiting the program.




Conclusion
This code demonstrates the basic functionality of a BST with user interaction via a console application. It provides a clear and straightforward way to understand and manipulate a BST using standard operations like insertion, deletion, search, and inorder traversal.
